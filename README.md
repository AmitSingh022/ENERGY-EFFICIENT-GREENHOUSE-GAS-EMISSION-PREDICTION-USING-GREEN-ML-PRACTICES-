# ENERGY-EFFICIENT-GREENHOUSE-GAS-EMISSION-PREDICTION-USING-GREEN-ML-PRACTICES-
You have annual supply chain emission data from 2010–2016 categorized into industries and commodities. The goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins based on descriptive and quality metrics (substance, unit, reliability, temporal/geographical/technological/data collection correlations, etc.)and also track its carbon emissions with used model.
